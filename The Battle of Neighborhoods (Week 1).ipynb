The same methodology can be applied in accordance to demands as applicable. This case is also applicable for anyone interested in exploring starting or locating a new business in any city. Lastly, it can also serve as a good practical exercise to develop Data Science skills.\n"

I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.\n- Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.\n- Data will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc.\n\n\nThe procesing of these DATA will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n- what is the cost of rent (per square ft) around a mile radius from each subway metro station?\n- what is the area of Manhattan with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?\n- What is the distance from work place ( Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future home?\n- What are the venues of the two best places to live? How the prices compare?\n- How venues distribute among Manhattan neighborhoods and around metro stations?\n- Are there tradeoffs between size and price and location?\n- Any other interesting statistical data findings of the real estate and overall data.\n\n"
